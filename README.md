# Overview

Training a language model involves several crucial steps:

Loading Training Data: Gather relevant text data from various sources such as books, articles, or online forums.

Defining the Architecture: Choose or design the neural network architecture, including the number of layers and other architectural details.

Scaling Up: Scale up the architecture based on your requirements, potentially increasing the model's size or computational resources.

Training Process: Start the training process by feeding data into the model, adjusting parameters through backpropagation, and iteratively improving performance.

## Why Train Your Own Language Model?

While pre-trained models exist, training your own offers unique advantages:

Customization: Fine-tune for specific domains or tasks, incorporating specialized vocabulary and knowledge.

Control: Have full control over architecture, training process, and resulting model parameters.

Privacy: Ensure privacy by training with sensitive data securely.
